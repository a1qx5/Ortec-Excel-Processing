#TODO's:
1. only displpay values for total_diff at the LAST appearance of the employee - month relation
2. do NOT count vacantion days for diff or total_diff (and highlight that row in orange)
3. get rid of hardcoded month names (line 68)

UNCERTAINTIES:
-should the total_diff column tell the difference of hours of the relation [employee - project] (across all months)
    instead of [employee - month]?
